Data and corresponding errors are the same as stated in exercise A.

Covariance matrix:
   0.00089   8.75e-05 
  8.75e-05   1.25e-05 

Found fitting parameters + errors obtained from the covariance matrix:
a = 4.9587 +/- 0.0298
b = 0.1714 +/- 0.0035

Half-life of ThX: 4.045 +/- 0.0834 days
Table value: 3.6 days

The error of the half-life of ThX is estimated using the variance formula with the errors obtained for the individual fitting parameters.
